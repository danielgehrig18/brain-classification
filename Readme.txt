Summary of Approach:

1. - Convert the given raw data to a matrix of size 176x208x176 using a publically 
     available 3D-Data Reader ((c) 2010, Dirk-Jan Kroon).

    - Cut brain image int 3x3x3 chunks of equal size.

    - Generate an intensity histogram of every chunk using 3 bins.
    
    - Normalize the histogram to compensate for noise generated by varying 
     brain volume and the use of different MRI scanners or settings.
   
2.  - The features are the counts of elements in each bin of the histogram of each chunk,
    which gives 3*3*3*3 = 81 Features

3. - Train a classifier using ensembled decision trees. 

   - Optimize through bagging.

   - Crossvalidation through k-fold-cv.

4. - No post processing steps.
